#  *** Tuples  ***
# this is immutable and it has only methods that count and index. its like constants so if you want to modify the list in our application you can use tuples
# ex. numbers = (1, 2, 4, 8, 9)

#  *** onPacking  ***

# coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
# #
# # x = coordinates[0]
# # y = coordinates[1]
# # z = coordinates[2]
# #
# # alternate for the above code is in the below:- (Its called onpacking) even we can use onpacking in list as well
# x, y, z = coordinates
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)
