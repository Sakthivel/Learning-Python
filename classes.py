#  *** Classes  ***
#  To create a class use 'class' keyword. it will hold methods etc.,
#  Object is an instance of the class, we can create no of object from the class, but each object is different instance of the class.
#  It will hold the blueprint of the class
#  class name should be PascalCase {each word first letter should be in uppercase}
#  example
# class Point:
#     def move(self):
#         print('move')
#
#     def draw(self):
#         print('draw')
#
#
# point1 = Point()
# point2 = Point()
# point1.x = 10
# print(point1.x)  // output:- 10
# point1.draw()    // output:- draw
# point2.move()    // output:- move
